# Virtual Reality Motor and Cognitive Dual Training Task #
The dual VR task was inspired by a well-established cancelation task, the Toulouse-Piéron task, in the following referred as TP-VR. The VR implementation includes a first person virtual representation of the paretic arm, which is controlled via the RehabNetCP through various interfaces (see Figure). The virtual environment is composed by a grid of 25 tiles with different symbols, navigation arrows at the edge of the screen, a mini-map, and 3 target elements (out of a total of 9) in green. By means of physical movements and the use of different interface technologies, users can control the position of the virtual paretic arm on the screen. The selection of each tile is performed with the use of a timer while the virtual arm is hovering over. Consistent with the original Toulouse-Piéron task, the score is calculated with the following formula:

*Score = Correct - (Wrong + Ommissions) * 100/TotalTiles*
